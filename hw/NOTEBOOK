1)
    d) The files are identical, this were the expected to happen given we are converting from assembly code, given this the instructions if not identical should be very close.

    e) The files differs as expected, since one is a assembly code and the other is a binary dissambled, so their structure would certainly vary, but looking only for the instructions we only got one new line with an add instruction.

    f) The boot didn't booted in the QEMU emulator. "Boot failed: not a bootable disk"

    i) The instructions of both files still very similar, they mainly differ in the memory positions.
